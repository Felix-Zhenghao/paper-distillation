### HumanPlus: Humanoid Shadowing and Imitation from Humans

> Fu, Z., Zhao, Q., Wu, Q., Wetzstein, G., & Finn, C. (2024). HumanPlus: Humanoid Shadowing and Imitation from Humans. _arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.10454_.

- General Idea:

  1. **X-embodiment Shadow policy**: RGB third-vision human bahaviour -> humanoid bahaviour
  2. Data collection for behaviour cloning: Use shadow policy + human demonstration, humanoid get **egocentric binocular RGB camera** data of conducting a task.
- Some technical points

  1. During shadow policy training, the DoF of robot and human are diff. Need to map between paramatrization of these two. Then they can train policy using RL.
  2. RL policy inputs humanoid proprioception and a humanoid target pose; outputs target joint position&velocity. Then they have a PD controller to get torque.
- Limitations

  1. Fixed mapping between different DoF parametrization
  2. Error can be cascaded -> error of pose estimation & RL policy & testing error
  3. No long-horizon task because no large size of human demonstration
- Utilities

  1. Human pose paramatrization model: [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de)
  2. Human body pose sequence dataset: [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de)
  3. State-of-art body & hand pose estimation model: need survey

### GNM: A General Navigation Model to Drive Any Robot

> Shah, D., Sridhar, A., Bhorkar, A., Hirose, N., & Levine, S. (2023, May). Gnm: A general navigation model to drive any robot. In _2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)_ (pp. 7226-7233). IEEE.

- General Idea:

  1. Image-goal navigation (image observation of the goal position) to allow general formulation of the task
  2. Hand-crafted abstract action representation as policy output (execution depends on controller)
  3. Learnt embodiment context vector using consecutive past observations from robot's viewpoint and condition the policy on it.
- Limitation:

  1. Hand-craft action representation
  2. The embodiment vector mostly contains info of velocity,size, etc. Not 'what it can do' or affordance. So no 'brand-new' navigation strategy emerged tailored to the capabilities of new embodiments.

### Neural MP: A Generalist Neural Motion Planner

> Dalal, M., Yang, J., Mendonca, R., Khaky, Y., Salakhutdinov, R., & Pathak, D. (2024). Neural MP: A Generalist Neural Motion Planner. _arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.05864_.

- General Idea

  1. Diverse scene generation in simulation and use 3D object datasets
  2. Distill motion planning via visual imiation learning
  3. Test time optimization to enhance safety
  4. Just marginal improvement of perf and largely the same as [MÏ€Nets](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v205/fishman23a.html).
- Utilities

  1. Large 3D obj dataset [Objaverse](https://objaverse.allenai.org)

### MimicGen: A Data Generation System for Scalable Robot Learning using Human Demonstrations

> Mandlekar, A., Nasiriany, S., Wen, B., Akinola, I., Narang, Y., Fan, L., ... & Fox, D. (2023). Mimicgen: A data generation system for scalable robot learning using human demonstrations. _arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.17596_.

- General Idea

  1. Data augmentation paper: generate more data from a few human demonstrations
  2. Simple learning algorithm and hardware: naive behavior cloning + 1 * V100
  3. Tasks must be divisible into **object-centric subtasks** (see appedix K)
  4. Linear interpolation between each subtask
  5. Use $T^A_B$ frame transformation to generate new data with **fixed gripper-object relative pose**
- Limitation

  1. Object-centric subtask assumption (and exactly one obj per subtask)
  2. Naive data filtering (success or not)
  3. No guarantee on collision-free motion (especially during interpolation)
  4. Objects should be rigid-body and new data only has similar objects as source data
  5. Objects and robot bases can't be dynamic
  6. Can't support multi-arm tasks
- Utility

  1. Some related literatures in appendix: Full related work section & motivation for mimicgen over alternative methods section
